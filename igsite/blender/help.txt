The file post_json.py is a blender script to send mesh objects in a scene up to the website.

Instructions:

In order for this to work, you need to point the website:
url = http://[host:port]/datastore/uploadjson

Set:
secret = [your secret key] - this can be found in the mysql database, but will be visible on your profile page later

Select the mesh objects in the seen you wish to export.

Run the script from blender.

This may not work if the python module 'requests' does not exist or blender cannot find it.

You would first need to install requests as a site package for python3.  This means that python3 must be in your
system path prior to installing the 'requests' module, otherwise it may install to older versions of python.

Blender also installs python3 in it's own file system, so you would either need to move requests into the correct
path for blender to find it as one of it's site packages or add it to the blender path:

import sys

sys.path.append([path to python3 site packages]) - (The path containing the requests module)

Notes:

So far this only exports mesh objects, in terms of triangulated vertices and normals.
It will also send uv coordinates if the object has texturing, but not the textures themselves.
It also does not sent lights, cameras, transforms, bones, skinning information etc.
But this will change as the project progresses.
The abilty to choose from some stock shaders or write your own will be added to the website in due course as well.
I may also add key frame information for small animations as well.
